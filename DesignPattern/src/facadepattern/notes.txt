1)will implement the facade pattern, the facade pattern makes a complex system easy to use for the

client applications.

2)Facade pattern was much more popular in the age old days of EJBs and remote procedural calls where the

client, instead of making multiple network calls to get the job done, he can make a single call to

Facade class, which will make all the other calls that are required within the system.

3)Instead of making multiple restful calls into the same API, the provider can expose out a facade class,

which can be one more layer on top of the restful classes, and it can reduce the complexity in the

network calls for the client.

4)So Facade simply hides the complexity of the system by becoming a layer in between, the client will only
know about the facade and it hides all the other complexity.
